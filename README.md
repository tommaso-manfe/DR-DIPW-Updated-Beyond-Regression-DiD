# Updated-Beyond-Regression-DiD
This folder contains the coding material of the working paper original working paper “Alternative Semi-Parametric Approaches and Machine Learning Algorithms in The Difference-In-Difference Design: a Monte-Carlo Evaluation” (2022) now renamed "Difference-In-Difference Design With Repeated
Cross-Sections Under Compositional Changes" which compares new semi-parametric estimators for the DiD design under compositional changes with the traditional DiD regression.

The folder is organized as follows:
- "Simulations Guthub": the coding material of the Monte Carlo simulations in the paper. The experiments are named following the paper and they are run through sbatch for    computational purposes.
- "Application Guthub": the coding material of the replication of the paper "Corruption, trade costs, and gains from tariff liberalization: Evidence from southern africa" of Siqueira (2016) where new estimation methods are employed.
